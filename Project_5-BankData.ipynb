    "## Project 5 algorithmic fairness\n",
    "Algorithm fairness is becoming a fundamental topic in ML. It is a complex ethical task to define what fairness is/means. Once we have defined quantitatively what fairness is then, from a mathematical perspective, the problem of  algorithmic fairness is very clear: it is a multi-objective optimization problem. There are multi objectives that we aim to optimize during data fitting, e.g., accuracy and fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to implement from scratch the \"fair\" **linear and nonlinear SVM** described in the following paper (see in particular Appendix A that reports the optimization problem)  \n",
    "\n",
    "[\"Fairness Constraints: Mechanisms for Fair Classification\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05259.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "and reproduce the experiments reported in the paper. In particular, apply your method to the Adult and Bank \n",
    "data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook must include:\n",
    "* a description (summary) of the algorithm presented in the above paper (focusing on SVM), similar to the theoretical details of logistic regression I wrote at the beginning of the notebook for e-tivity Task A (week 1&2). The reader must understand from your explanation the difference between standard SVM and the \"fair\" SVM.\n",
    "* You implementation of the \"fair\" **linear and nonlinear SVM** using CVXOPT to solve data fitting (as I have shown in Week 3 webinar, see also example below). You should implement it as a Python class (similar to logistic regression class for E-tivity 1).\n",
    "* A test of the input-output behavior of your algorithm. More clearly, you have to replicate the experiment results you find in Section 4.1 for Synthetic Data and Section 4.2 of the above paper for the Adult and Bank data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources:\n",
    "* Week 3 webinar slides with the details of the SVM algorithm;\n",
    "* [Example](https://xavierbourretsicotte.github.io/SVM_implementation.html) about how to use the library CVXOPT to implement data fitting for standard SVM\n",
    "* [fairness-in-machine-learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-tutorial-on-fairness-in-machine-learning-3ff8ba1040cb)\n",
    "* (Optional) Multi-objective optimization and Pareto optimality see Book chapter 12 (of our Module's book).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to approach the problem** (this is just a suggestion).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start implementing linear SVM and apply it to the Synthetic Data experiment in Section 4.1 so that you can plot the classification line for standard linear SVM versus fair linear SVM.\n"
